# Hello there I'm Stephanie ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile. I am a Junior Developer from London. I have recently been studying for a Diploma in Fullstack Software Development with the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) and have now finished my fifth and final Portfolio Project for the course. I am looking forward to using my new skils and learning many new ones in a Developer role.
